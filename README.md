# Flask To-Do App

This is a simple Flask-based to-do app that allows you to add and remove tasks. It uses a SQLite database to store the tasks. 
(I know it is pretty basic, only made it to learn flask)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the hello_app folder.
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `flask run`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`.
2. Add a task by filling out the form and clicking "Add Task".
3. Remove a task by clicking the "Remove" button next to the task.
